### Python Live project
A two week sprint with other developers to work on web applications on the same site.

### C# Live Project
A two week sprint with other developers to work on adding backend capabilities on the same project.

### Car Insurance
C# project where we allow users to submit information and get a quote based of logic.  Also allow Admins to view the list of all quotes.

### NewsletterAppMVC
C# project where we make a simple sign up app for a newsletter.  Practice with the MVC approach to web app development.

### Shipping Quota
C# project console app where we get a shipping quote from the dimensions entered in by a user.

### TwentyOne
C# project console app that plays the game TwentyOne with the user, simulating a Casino game.

### Phone Book
Python project using tkinter to draw a UI that allows the user to manipulate a database with contact information

### File Transfer Program
Python project using tkinter to allow the user to move files from on directory with a set critrea to another file directory.

### Web Page Generator
Python project using tkinter to let a user make a HTML doc with inputted text or a default html doc, and then serve it up in the browser

### Django Checking Account
Python project using the Django framework that lets a user establish an account with a balance, and then make deposits and withdrawals, all while keeping those transactions for the user.

### Pizza Project
One of the first examples of Java script coding, it is a barebones receipt generator for a fictional pizza place.

### TicTacToe
Using JavaScript we made a very TicTacToe Program, very cool to develop a game, even if all the computer does is pick a random, open slot.

### ToDo App
Using DOM and XML we can create a ToDo App that actually 'remembers' what you put in it.

### Calculator
A bit more practical use for JavaScript.  Very nifty to code something that is so common nowadays.

### Space Station website
This webpage was an example homepage for a space travel company.  An exercise in general CSS use for styling

### One-Page Website
Going off of the previous exercise we added some personalization to the creation process, including a video.  We enhanced it further with a modal for the image gallery.

### Movie Theater
Using Bootstrap 4, we developed a simple site.  We enhanced it furthur using JavaScript to do pop ups and the like

### My Github Page
This exercise was the final assignment of the course. Enhanced later with JavaScript for the next section.  Very cool to have something that actually lives on the internet.
